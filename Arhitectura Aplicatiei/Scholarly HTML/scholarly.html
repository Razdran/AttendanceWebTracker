            Create an application that allows online presence on activities associated with an academic program
            - for example, course / laboratory / seminar classes for each discipline or participation in a contest.
            The tool will support both participants (ie students) and people who want the presence (eg, lab, event
            organizer).
            Additionally, people present can be awarded scores and / or associate content terms (tags) or notes. To
            appeal to
            an effective method of preventing false presence. Generic, through data viewing techniques, intermediate or
            final
            reports on the presence and scores accumulated by an individual / group, including statistics, comparisons,
            multi-criteria
            filtering, etc. will be generated. The data will be imported from an external web storage source and
            exported as JSON and
            HTML5 + documents and related microdata schemes.

                        Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. With
                        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript, it forms a triad of cornerstone technologies for the World Wide
                        Web. Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into
                        multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for
                        the appearance of the document.                </li>

                        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written
                        in a markup language like HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.
                        CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts. This
                        separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation
                        characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css
                        file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content.

                        JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, interpreted programming language. It is a language which is
                        also characterized as dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based and multi-paradigm. Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript
                        is one of the three core technologies of the World Wide Web. JavaScript enables interactive web pages and thus
                        is an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use it, and all major web browsers have
                        a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.

						Firebase provides a realtime database and backend as a service. The service provides application developers an API 
						that allows application data to be synchronized across clients and stored on Firebase's cloud
						We also use the Firebase hosting service.It is a good choice because the files are delivered through HTTPS and SSL encryption
						The import functionality will be implemented via firebase storage which is backed by Google Cloud Storage.

						We are using chart.js library for generating statistics through data visualisation.We can create simple HTML5 Charts using canvas
						element. chart.js is the most download charting library and is very well documented.There are a lot of detailed informations for 
						each feature provided. It offers responsive and interactive graphics.It also has only 11kb so its loading time and page impact
						are low.

						The Google Geolocation API returns a location and accuracy radius based on information about cell towers and WiFi nodes that the 
						mobile client can detect.This offers us an efficient way to prevent any try of fraud in attendance list.Communication is done
						over HTTPS using POST. Both request and response are formatted as JSON, and the content type of both is application/json.

                Our app will be serverless so all the data needded will be stored via Google firebase.This is convenient
				because it is easy to access data and files,and we get rid of the server infrastructure needed in storing
				data. We will use primarly JSON format because we use Javascript and so we can parse data natively using
				the JSON.parse() function.

				On the client side we will retrieve data from the firebase database service,we show the
