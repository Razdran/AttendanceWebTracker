            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                AttendanceWebTracker is an application that allows online presence on activities associated with an
                academic program
                - for example, course / laboratory / seminar classes for each discipline or participation in a contest.
                The tool will support both participants (ie students) and people who want the presence (eg, lab, event
                organizer).
                Additionally, people present can be awarded scores and / or associate content terms (tags) or notes. To
                appeal to
                an effective method of preventing false presence. Generic, through data viewing techniques, intermediate
                or
                final
                reports on the presence and scores accumulated by an individual / group, including statistics,
                comparisons,
                multi-criteria
                filtering, etc. will be generated. The data will be imported from an external web storage source and
                exported as JSON and
                HTML5 + documents and related microdata schemes.

            In the last several weeks we changed our application entirely. We created a new design and we changed the mainflow of our app.
            <p>Actually, we started the application from the ground, again. This fact made us to work harder in order to deliver
                the application on time. In the end, our application is done and has all the features we had to add.

                <p>
                        Teachers need a smart way to keep track of courses, grades and attendance. It is
                        a lot easier to just create a class on our app and ask the students to enter there
                        and mark themselfs as present. In this way, the teacher can give grades and feedback
                        to every student. Beside that, this Attendance Web Tracker is safe because
                        a student can mark himself present based on his geolocation ,unlike the old fashion
                        way where students have to write their name on a piece of paper because they canr write
                        as many names as they like.
